# Data-Analysis-of-Play-Store-Apps
In this we have analyzed the data present on kaggle for the various apps present in play store. We have done each type of regression technique as well as gradient descent , as well as random forest, bagging regressor and k-nearest neighbours. We are also providing a report in which we have noted down each type of observation which can be observed.
We have also explained about each technique as a report as this is our project in statistical learning in IIIT naya raipur.
We have also published this as a research paper in 2022 IEEE GlobConet whose link is : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9872426
